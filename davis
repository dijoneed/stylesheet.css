<h1>Demoliton Man Review</h1>
<p> Demolition man was a very popular film released to the United States on October 8th, 1993. The director of the Rated R film  is Marci Brambilla and it was produced by Joel Silver, Michael Levy, and Howard Kazanijan (Demolition man). The main characters in this film are John Spartan (who is a cop) and Simon Phoenix (who is a criminal) and it appears to primarily be based in California. Both Simon and John get sent to the same prison and are sentenced to be frozen at “Cyto Prison”. Years later in 2032, John is thawed so his body is no longer frozen  and he is now in what is now called, “San Angeles” which is a completely different world compared to the world he lived in prior to his prison sentence that took place decades ago. Even though John has been put away for a long time, he still has his cop mentality to protect and serve so he joins an alliance with Lenina to catch Simon. I found this movie to be entertaining in class, I was amazed by the well detailed physical and verbal action, the guns, the gun noises whenever someone shot their gun. The lightening and music in the scenes being based on the present  mood was something that also caught my attention. What I loved the most about this film and other Science-Fiction film is that the good guys always reign at the end.</p>
